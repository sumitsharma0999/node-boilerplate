# node-boilerplate
This is a boiler-plate code to quickly get started with creating an npm package or a node-js application.

Whenever one starts a new [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/") project, there are few basic things which need to be set up almost always.
Some of these tasks are
- Setting up babel for transpiling (**Hello ecmascript 6**)
- Setting up test framework (Mocha etc.)
- Setting up automated task runner (Gulp ?)

This boiler-plate code can save the time spent on the setting up above tasks. When starting a new Node project, clone this repository and build on top of that.
